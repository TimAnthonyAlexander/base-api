A tiny, KISS-first PHP 8.4+ framework for building REST APIs.

BaseAPI is designed to get out of your way and let you build APIs quickly and efficiently.
It provides all the essential tools you need while maintaining simplicity and performance.

[Documentation Here](https://baseapi.timanthonyalexander.de)

## âœ¨ Features

- **Low Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **High Performance** - Minimal overhead, maximum speed (<1ms overhead per request)
- **Built-in Security** - CORS, rate limiting, and authentication middlewares included
- **Database Agnostic** - Automatic migrations from model definitions, supports MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL
- **Unified Caching** - Multi-driver caching system with Redis, File, and Array stores plus tagged cache invalidation
- **Internationalization** - Full i18n support with multiple automatic translation providers (OpenAI, DeepL)
- **Auto Documentation** - Generate OpenAPI specs and TypeScript types with one command

## Quick Start

### Create a New Project

In order to set up a new BaseAPI project, run:

```bash
composer create-project baseapi/baseapi-template my-api
cd my-api
```

This will create a new project in the `my-api` directory.
It will contain a User model, and some basic controllers:

```php
app/Controllers/MeController.php
app/Controllers/LoginController.php
app/Controllers/HealthController.php
app/Controllers/SignupController.php
app/Controllers/LogoutController.php
```

From there, you can easily create new models and controllers and immediately start building your API.
